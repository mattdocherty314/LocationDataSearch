# Location Data Search
## Overview
This is a client webpage that gathers all of the known and chosen datasets which are within the target area. It collects the data in a synchronous manner so it appears to be really slow but it isn't. Version 1.0.0 was made as a part of GovHack 2018 (which ran from 7 - 9 Sept 2018), the team responsible was [LocateData](https://2018.hackerspace.govhack.org/team_management/teams/105)

## Dependencies
* Any modern browser

## Debugging
If you run into any errors please make sure you are on this version because it is known to work. If you still are having issues on the aforementioned version, just send me a message on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mattdocherty314)

## Program Use
Just load the file `index.html` into any browser and enter the relevant information into the fields and give it up to a minute to run. It has only got Queensland datasets at the moment.
