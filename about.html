        <h1> Location Data Search </h1>
        <h2> About </h2>
        
        <p><strong>What is the goal? </strong></p>
        <li>People can search for 'electronics store in Brisbane CBD' and find what they're looking for but searching for 'Accident Data Brisbane CBD' returns semi-relevant or irrelevant data.</li>
        <li>You can search for the data in the 'Input Data' search box andthe location in the 'Location Search' box. This will return all the data it has found.</li>

        <p><strong>What did you use? </strong></p>
        <li>Plain NodeJS was used as the server.</li>
        <li>HTML, CSS & JavaScript was used to develop the client.</li>
        <li>OpenStreetMaps was used with Leaflet to display the location data.</li>
        
        <p><strong>What were the roles?</strong></p>
        <li>Matthew: Communicating with the APIs and the search.</li>
        <li>Reuben: Displays the data in a meaningful format.</li>

        <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
        <li>'Data Search' searches the description of the data for matching values.</li>
        <li>'Location Search' searches the data's GPS co-ords for if it is within the range.</li>
        <li>Once the data found it is returned as JSON and is filtered through the output methods.</li>

        <p><strong>What were some of the difficulties?</strong></p>
        <li>Getting all the names of the same type of data, e.g Longitude/Long & Latitude/Lat.</li>
        <li>Interacting with the API.</li>

        <p><strong>What still needs to be done?</strong></p>
        <li>Designing the UI.</li>
        <li>Adding a way to add datasets.</li>
        <li>More search filters.</li>
